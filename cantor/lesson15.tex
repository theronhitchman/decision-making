Discuss the Cantor Set construction.
Use the binary and ternary representations with LR and lcr to show that $\mathcal{R}$ has a matching with the Cantor set, but have students measure the Cantor set to get length zero.

Discuss the weirdness.
Point out that there are several versions of the word "size" and bigger depends on what measure you are using.
