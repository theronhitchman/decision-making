We continue thinking about alternate representations of real numbers.
In your reading, you have encountered decimal (base $10$) notation and binary (base $2$) notation for elements of the set $\mathcal{R}$.

\begin{task}
Now we will use a \emph{ternary} (base three) system. Instead of dividing each piece into ten identical pieces, divide into identical thirds, which you can think of as ``left,'' ``center,'' and ``right.''
We use the symbols $l$, $c$, and $r$ for this system.

Locate the intervals represented by the symbols $l$, $c$, $r$, $ll$, $lc$, $lr$, $cl$, $cc$, $cr$, $rl$, $rc$, $rl$, $rrlc$ and $lrlrccr$.
\end{task}

\begin{task}
Working now with countably infinite strings, describe how to locate a real number that is described by mathematical word consisting of the symbols $l$, $c$ and $r$.\\
\end{task}

\begin{task}
Show that $\mathcal{R}$ has the same size as the set $\mathcal{I}$ of all countably infinite mathematical words consisting of the letters $l$, $c$ and $r$.\\
\end{task}

In a previous meeting, we named the set of all elements of $\mathcal{I}$ which do not contain the letter $c$ to be $\mathcal{I}_c$, and we found a matching between the elements of $\mathcal{C}$ and the elements of $\mathcal{I}_c$.
So, somehow, these two sets ``have the same number of elements.''\\

\begin{task}
Draw a representation of the set of all real numbers represented in ternary $l$-$c$-$r$ notation that do not have $c$ as the first letter.
How long is this set?\\
\end{task}

\begin{task}
Draw a representation of the set of all real numbers represented in ternary $l$-$c$-$r$ notation that do not have $c$ as the first or second letter. How long is this set? \\
\end{task}

\begin{task}
Draw a representation of the set of all real numbers represented in ternary $l$-$c$-$r$ notation that do not have $c$ as the first, second, or third letter.
How long is this set? \\
\end{task}

\begin{task}
Draw a representation of the set $\mathcal{I}_c$ of all real numbers whose ternary representation does not use the letter $c$. \\
\end{task}

\begin{task}
What can you say about the length of the set $\mathcal{I}_c$?
\end{task}
