Let $T$ be the set of ways to represent $10$ as the sum of four positive integers. 
We will consider two representations as the same if you can get from one to the other by  a reordering. 
In fact, to avoid this, we just require that the terms in the sum must either stay the same or decrease.

Let $J$ be the set of ways to represent $10$ as a sum of positive integers (not necessarily four of them), where the biggest number used is $4$.
Again, order should not be important.
If you wish, you can avoid this by assuming that the terms in the sum must either stay the same or decrease.

\textbf{Find and describe a matching between the elements of $T$ and the elements of $J$.}

You should describe your matching in clear enough language that someone from our class who has not yet tried this exercise can read and understand your work.

\textit{Hint: If you are feeling stuck, you might find it useful to think about dot pictures.}
