\vspace{.5in}

There are $n = $\underline{\hspace{2in}} people here today.
As a class, you have two tasks.

\begin{task}
How many teams of two people can be chosen out of the $n$ people we have here? We want to see, so let's begin by making a list. I suggest you start by dividing up the work. Each person should figure out all of the teams he or she could be on.\\

Make a list of all of the teams you are on. You might have to meet some classmates! We'll talk about combining our information in a little bit.
\end{task}

\begin{task}
How many teams of $n - 2 = $ \underline{\hspace{2in}} people can we form from those who are here today? Again, we want to make a list. I suggest you start by dividing up the work. Each person should figure out all of the teams he or she could be on.\\

Make a list of all of the teams you are on. You have already met your classmates, but think about how you will organize this list. We will talk about combining our information in a little bit.
