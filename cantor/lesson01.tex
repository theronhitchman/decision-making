\textbf{\Huge
Lesson Plan: Meeting One
}
\end{center}
\vspace{.5in}

The main goals for the day:
\begin{compactitem}
\item set up the ideas of set, element and subset. Hope to embody the concepts very literally.
\item presage the idea of matching
\item present a non-trivial counting problem
\end{compactitem}

Give students time to work on the two tasks in the meeting01.tex handout.
Expect some confusion about what counts as an element of these sets.
Be careful not to overdo it with the technical language at first.

After 10 minutes of work on the first task, try to summarize the ideas by writing some of their lists on the board as sets.
See if any of them can use these ideas to make a clear accounting.

Then give them time to think about the second problem.
Point out that these lists are now impractical to work with, so maybe they can find a way around this.
Hint that the problems might be connected somehow.
