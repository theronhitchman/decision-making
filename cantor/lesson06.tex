\textbf{\Huge
Lesson Plan: Meeting Six
}
\end{center}
\vspace{.5in}

Time to recap some big ideas, but with new tasks.

Major Themes:

\begin{compactitem}
\item What is a matching, and why are they good for comparing sizes?
\item How is counting just like matching, and how is that like making a list?
\end{compactitem}

\vspace{.1in}

The first two tasks are chosen to emphasize these.

\vspace{.1in}

Also, prepare the ground for more challenging ideas to come:
\begin{compactitem}
\item abstractions of numbers and number systems.
\item clear use of fancy language for plain things.
\end{compactitem}

\vspace{.1in}

The last two tasks are chosen for this.
Note that the terms \emph{power set} and \emph{initial segment} reappear, and that the new terms \emph{countably infinite} and \emph{$0/1$ sequences} show up.
