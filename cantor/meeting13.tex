Up until now, our sets of ``mathematical words" only contained words of finite length. That is, the set $\mathcal{W}$ we considered last time has a lot of elements, but the representation of each individual element of $\mathcal{W}$ has to stop at some point. A word in $\mathcal{W}$ can be really long, but can't go on forever.

Now we are going to change that. The set $\mathcal{C}$ consists of all infinite length mathematical words made up of the two uppercase letters L and R. Here are the \emph{beginnings} of some words in $\mathcal{C}$.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c}
LLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL \dots \\[.2cm]
LRLRLRLRLRLRLRLRLRL \dots \\[.2cm]
RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR \dots \\[.2cm]
LRLRRRLRRRRLRRRRRL \dots \\[.2cm]
LRLRLLRRLLRLRRRRLRL \dots\\[.5cm]
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
Similarly, we consider a set $\mathcal{I}$ which is made up of all infinite length mathematical words made up of the three lowercase letters l, c and r. For example, here are the \emph{beginnings} of three words in the set $\mathcal{I}$:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c}
llllllclrlllclrlclll \dots \\[.2cm]
cclrrrrrrrrrlclrl \dots \\[.2cm]
ccccccccclccccc \dots \\[.5cm]
\end{tabular}
\end{center}


\begin{task}
The set $\mathcal{I}_c$ is the subset of all elements of $\mathcal{I}$ which don't ever use the letter c. Design a matching between the elements of $\mathcal{C}$ and the elements of $\mathcal{I}_c$.
\end{task}
