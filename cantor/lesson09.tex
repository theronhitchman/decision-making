\vspace{.5in}

\section{Phase One}
Discuss briefly the idea and structure of an argument by contradiction.

\section{Phase Two}
Do a sequence of Think-Pair-Share questions. 
Make pairs of students for the day.

Do not hand out all the questions!
Instead, project them onto the screen and have students write out their responses on blank paper. 
Put a decent student response on the board and get the class to help revise it.

After class, type up all of the ``best'' answers and distribute.
