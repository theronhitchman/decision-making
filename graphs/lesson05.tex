\subsection*{The Plan}

Get into new groups.  Handout the file mdm-graphs-handout-day05.pdf. 

Discuss the first puzzle in groups. Try to get them to abstract it. This takes a lot of time and effort, as it
is a new task for them.

Then try the next two puzzles.

Added at end of day:: This day was quiet and not very exciting. I wish I had a way to make this "physical."
