\subsection*{The Plan}

Peer Instruction Questions to help sort out all of the crazy terminology we have introduced. \\

Hand out the four graphs on the document mdm-graphs-handout-day04.pdf. \\

\begin{enumerate}
\item What is the degree of the vertex labeled $x$ in Graph A?
\item What is the degree sequence of Graph B?
\item Which graphs are Trees?
\item Does Graph A have a cycle of length 4?
\item Is Graph B a planar graph?
\item Is Graph A a planar graph?
\item Does Graph B have a simple cycle of length 5?\\
\end{enumerate}

Take time to return papers, take questions, etc.
