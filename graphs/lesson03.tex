\subsection*{Phase One: Think-Pair-Share on non-isomorphism}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Hand out file mdm-graphs-handout-day03.pdf
\item Draw graphs on the board
\item Do a TPS for each of the four pairs: ``How do you know that these graphs are not isomorphic?''
\end{enumerate}

Goal: pull out the following vocabulary
\begin{itemize}
\item degree of a vertex
\item degree sequence of a graph
\item cycle
\item length of a cycle
\end{itemize}

NOTE: first time I did this, I put the graphs on the board and recorded results on the TPS activity underneath each pair. Some of the reasons were just flat out wrong. At conclusion, I told them "at least one of these is wrong" and gave them a few minutes to find them. We discussed.

\subsection*{Phase Two: Challenge}

(10 minutes) Find a pair of non-isomorphic, connected graphs where the following things match: number of vertices, number of edges, degree sequence. (write that down carefully for them)

\subsection*{Short Break}

\subsection*{Euler's Formula}

\begin{itemize}
\item Show off some neat student examples from last time. (document camera)
\item Give Conway's ``pillaging'' proof of Euler's formula.
\end{itemize}

Note: idea of a tree will come up.
