\section*{Phase 1}
Ask them to use Reidemeister Moves to show a figure 8 knot is equivalent to its mirror image.

Draw the knots on the chalkboard. This facilitates the discussion.

\section*{Phase 2}
If there is time, ask them to work on the *nasty unkot* example from meeting 6 question 5. (This knot reappears in Assignment \#3.)

\section*{Announcment}
After class, send them a worked out version of a solution to Phase 1.
