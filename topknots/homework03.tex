We have seen the following knot before, and noted that it is a planar projection of an unknot.
Show that this knot is equivalent to the unknot be describing a sequence of Reidemeister moves which change this planar projection into an ordinary circle.
Draw pictures of the steps along the way, and clearly label each transition with the type of move made.
