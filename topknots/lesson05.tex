Lesson Plan: Meeting Five
}

\vspace{.5in}

Activity Day: Human Knot game. Take class outside if the weather cooperates.

\section*{Phase One}
four person groups "any old connections."
Try to untangle.
Check for knots or links.
(Links are more likely.)\\

Next try six person groups (maybe five)\\

Then apply rules:
\begin{compactitem}
\item if group has even number of people: everyone grasps a right hand of someone \emph{not} next to them with their right hand.
\item if group has odd number of people: all but one person does that, but the last person uses right hand to grab some left hand not next to them.
\item Then grab left hands of people not next to them.
\end{compactitem}

\section*{Phase Two}
Do larger groups: Say size 7 or 8 with the rules \\

Sum up discussion with ideas of "knot," "link," and "isotopy" for topological equivalence

\section*{Phase Three}
\begin{quote}
``What are your Questions?''
\end{quote}

\section*{Announcement}

Get string, cord, shoelaces, etc for manipulatives.
