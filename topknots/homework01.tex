Please write a short \emph{Mathematical Autobiography}.
I think a single page should be enough.\\

I want to know something about your attitude towards mathematics, and your relationship with the subject.
Feel free to address whatever you want to share.
In case you are feeling at a loss for where to start, consider the following questions:
\begin{itemize}
\item Do you enjoy mathematics? Why or why not?
\item Have you had a particularly good experience studying mathematics?
If so, what made it work for you?
\item Have you had a particularly negative experience with mathematics?
If so, what made it so negative?
\item What do you hope to get out of our class this term?
\end{itemize}
I don't expect you to cover each question. Rather, use these as a starting point for your thinking.\\[.25in]


This is a writing assignment, so I expect attention to standard grammar and usage.
I would prefer a typed and printed page.
