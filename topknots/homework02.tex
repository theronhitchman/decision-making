\textbf{Written Assignment \#2}
}
\end{center}

In one written page, describe what the puzzle PHP3-2 is, give a solution, and describe how you know it works.
You should write as if you are describing this to a friend who is not in our class, but could be. 
(If it helps, choose someone real about whom you can think when writing.)

\section*{Specifications for Grading}

To earn a passing mark, your assignment must:
\begin{itemize}
\item be typed, and at least one page and no more than two pages in length. Diagrams
may be hand drawn, but should be clear enough to read easily.
\item address the writing prompt above.
\item include a complete discussion of the puzzle and your solution, and why you know it works.
\item conform to reasonable standards for grammar, spelling, and usage of the English language with minimal errors. (You may consider seeking help on writing from the Writing Center in the Academic Learning Center. http://www.uni.edu/unialc/writing-center)

\end{itemize}
