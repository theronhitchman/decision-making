\subsection*{Context and History for the Reidemeister moves}
We have seen that the natural way to view two knots as equivalent is the notion of \emph{ambient isotopy}.
We have also played around enough to see that this is very tricky.
There is no way to collect ``all of the ambient isotopies possible'' and make sure we have checked them---there are simply too many strange things one can do.

Fortunately, there is a way around this, first described by J.~W.~Alexander and G.~B.~Briggs \cite{AB} and independently by H.~Reidemeister \cite{R}.
There are some simple manipulations one can do to a planar projection of a knot, called \emph{Reidemeister moves}.
They are important because of the following result, which was proved in the 1920's.
\begin{theorem}
Suppose that one is given two planar projections of knots.
Then these knots are equivalent by ambient isotopy if and only if there is a finite sequence of \emph{Reidemeister moves} which turns one planar projection into the other.
\end{theorem}

This is exceedingly good news!
You don't have to check ``everything,'' just sequences of these special moves on knots.

The general problem for comparing two knots is still unsolved, but significant work has been done on the ``unknotting problem.''
\begin{problem}[The Unknotting Problem]
When and how can you tell if a given planar projection of a knot actually represents the unknot?
\end{problem}
It is known that there is an algorithm for deciding this question, but the paper describing it  (by Haken \cite{Haken}) is well over 100 pages long.
In principle, this means someone could program a computer to check if a given diagram was an unknot or not.
[I do not believe anyone has done this.]
One problem that could occur is that even if such a computer program could be designed, it might take an unreasonably long time to compute and give you a response.
How long might it take?
In 1998, Joel Hass and Jeffrey Lagarias proved that it might be long, but not \emph{too} long.
Specifically, they showed this:
\begin{theorem}
For any planar projection of the unknot having $n$ crossings, there is a sequence of Reidemeister moves which transforms the projection into a regular circle and takes no more than $2^{10^{11}n}$ moves.
\end{theorem}

%That is a big number.
%In particular, if $n=6$, then $2^{10^{11}\cdot 6}$ is big enough to break my best computer algebra system.
%Fortunately, computers are getting faster and faster.


\subsection*{The Reidemeister Moves}

So what are the Reidemeister moves?
Each move describes a way in which you can change some small bit of information about a crossing in your planar projection without changing the essential qualities of the knot.
There are three types of moves, and they are easier to see than to describe.

Reidemeister Move 1 either twists or untwists a simple loop in a single strand.
Note this changes the number of crossings by one: an increase of one crossing if adding a twist, a decrease of one crossing if removing a twist.

        \caption{Type 2 Reidemesiter Moves}
    \end{subfigure}
    \caption{Reidemeister Moves of type 1 and 2}
\end{figure}

Reidemeister Move 2 either creates or removes a pair of consecutive overcrossings (or undercrossings) of one strand across another.
Note that this changes the number of crossings by 2, up or down.

Type 3 Reidemeister moves do not change the number of crossings in the planar projection, as all we do is move one strand completely across a crossing of two other strands.

\subsubsection*{Examples and Practice}

Let us see how to handle some examples of equivalence of planar projections using Reidemeister moves and isotopy.

\begin{example}
A simple trefoil with a cheap disguise.
We just untwist.
\end{example}

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=.3\textwidth]{knotpics/trefoil-bad-disguise.png}
    \caption{Trefoil with glasses and a fake mustache.}
\end{figure}

\begin{example}
A trefoil with a better disguise.
Here we bring the far right strand ``under the rest of the diagram'' and then untwist.
\end{example}

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \begin{subfigure}{.4\textwidth}
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{knotpics/trefoil-better1.png}
        \caption{The first few RMs.}
    \end{subfigure}
    \hspace{2cm}
    \begin{subfigure}{.4\textwidth}
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{knotpics/trefoil-better2.png}
        \caption{More RMs, the middle stages.}
     \end{subfigure}
     \caption{Applying Reidemeister Moves to an odd projection of a Trefoil.}
\end{figure}
Note that the upper left projection in Figure 4b is the same as the lower left in Figure 4a.
We are getting closer.
The final few diagrams look like this:

    \caption{Finally!}
\end{figure}

Well, that was exciting.
Now we should practice.

\begin{exercise} Consider the two planar projections of the figure eight knot below.
These are equivalent by a process similar to our second example above.
Use a sequence of Reidemeister moves to demonstrate that these knots are equivalent.
Draw each intermediate knot, and label the sequence of Reidemeister moves you use as you go.
\end{exercise}

        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{knotpics/9SeptQ3a.png}
        \caption{The figure eight knot.}
    \end{subfigure}
    \hspace{2cm}
    \begin{subfigure}{.3\textwidth}
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{knotpics/9SeptQ3b.png}
        \caption{Another figure eight knot.}
    \end{subfigure}
    \caption{Show these are the same by Reidemeister moves.}
\end{figure}

\begin{challenge}
The following knot is due to Goeritz \cite{G}. It is known to be a projection of the unknot and it has 9 crossings.
Use a sequence of Reidemeister moves to show that this is the unknot.
Somewhere along the line, your diagram should have more than 9 crossings.
\end{challenge}
